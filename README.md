People with arm and hand impairments find it difficult to utilize a standard wheelchair since 
their hands are incapable of operating it and cannot move it in any direction. As a result, a 
voice-operated wheel chair is designed to overcome such people's difficulties and enable 
them to manage the wheelchair. The wheelchair will be controlled by voice instructions 
using the input provided. The Arduino will handle all of the user's desired directives. Each 
direction's instructions are written in the form of a program in the Arduino itself. The 
unilateral mic, which will be positioned according to the user's comfort, will provide spoken 
commands to the wheelchair. The Voice recognition V3 module will do speech recognition. 
Arduino then receives the output from this module. The Arduino's pre-written algorithms 
assist Arduino in converting these vocal commands into significant output, and the 
wheelchair will move appropriately. People will gain independence by using a wheelchair 
control system. The wheelchair control system makes use of a speech recognition 
technology to trigger and control all of its motions. The technology allows users to operate 
the wheelchair by just speaking into the wheelchair's microphone. The fundamental 
movement functions are forward and reverse motion, left and right turns, and stop. The 
spoken words are sent to the speech recognition processor via a flexible microphone that 
can be bent to the user's specifications. Many physically handicapped people are unable to 
move any limbs below the neck. As a result, manual and even joystick-controlled 
wheelchairs are out of the question for these individuals. As a result, the development of 
voice-activated wheelchairs will answer the question of quadriplegic patients' movement 
and make them independent of mobility. In our project, we have both voice command and 
switch control. In this case, we utilized Arduino as a programming device. Where c has 
used programming to better the project. The major goal of this project is to Wheel Chair 
System Project for the main aim of creating a smart system so that we may reap numerous 
benefits from a single project. These are utilizing voice command or switching for wheel 
chair control, which sick patients or elderly people can easily operate; the goal is to build a 
contemporary one primarily for sick patients or the elderly. There are numerous advantages 
to such a system, including the following: it reduces human efforts, it is beneficial to 
physically disabled people who are unable to operate home appliances with their hands, it 
will help to save energy to some extent, because some people are too lazy to go and switch 
off the appliances manually, it is simple to use for those who have tried it and do not need 
to operate the home appliance manually by hand, and it reduces risk. The suggested system

has several drawbacks as well, such as the fact that it requires an additional supply to 
operate the model and that the module only recognizes the inserted voice and button. This 
type minimizes the amount of physical effort required to acquire and identify the command 
for controlling the mobility of a wheelchair. The given commands can be used to control 
the wheelchair's speed and direction. Thus, all that is required to ride the wheelchair is a 
trained voice. Aside from that, the development of this project may be done at a low cost. 
However, certain changes are needed to make this system more dependable. The 
wheelchair's design might be enhanced by including wireless communication. We can 
immediately improve the lives of handicapped persons in the community by establishing 
this system. Finally, we believe that this type of device will help to advance wheelchair 
technology. The intelligent wheelchair's motor drive and control system has been shown. 
The voice-controlled intelligent wheelchair based on a microcontroller would be more 
convenient for handicapped individuals. By avoiding collisions with walls, immovable 
objects, furniture, and other people, the device can also improve the safety of users who 
use standard joystick-controlled powered wheelchairs.
